# Intro

This is an out-of-box open-source miniprogram components kit in video community scenario.  
It includes basic UI components, such as `video-swiper`, `slider`, `comments-half-dialog`,  
and some business UI components like `tiktok-panel`, and `wechat-channel-panel`, etc.

Miniprogram-video-swiper-kit is based on the real massive user product in weChat miniprogram, and
features a suite of customization options that make it easy to implement your own custom business
design on top of these components.

These components are now used by the top miniprogram developers 
which they have grown to **over 500 millions users** in weChat.

## Motivation

why this project?

As the requirements of watching short video becoming increasingly common, 
the feature swiping up videos turning into an essential fundamental part of most products, 
especially in the community product.

So, it's essential to build an easy using, out of box swiping video component. The component is not provided 
by miniprogram officially, though it has a video-swiper component in miniprogram-component-plus, which is not perfectly 
compatible with some scenarios, such as some unexpected other video's voice playing when swiping the screen quickly, 
customizing play/pause state, and community interactive features, etc.

Based on the video-swiper, other out-of-box component follows, such as `slider`, `comments-half-dialog`, `tiktok-panel`, 
and `wechat-channel-panel` etc., with business bias features to build user friendly ui.
