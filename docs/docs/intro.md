# Intro

This is an out-of-box open-source miniprogram components kit in video community scenario.  
It includes basic UI components, such as `video-swiper`, `slider`, `comments-half-dialog`,  
and some business UI components like `tiktok-panel`, and `wechat-channel-panel`, etc.

Miniprogram-video-swiper-kit is based on the real massive user product in weChat miniprogram, and
features a suite of customization options that make it easy to implement your own custom business
design on top of these components.

These components are now used by the top miniprogram developers
which they have grown to **over 500 millions users** in weChat.

## Motivation

why this project?

As the requirements of watching short video becoming increasingly common,
the feature swiping up videos turning into an essential fundamental part of most products,
especially in the community product.

So, it's essential to build an easy using, out of box swiping video component. The component is not provided
by miniprogram officially, though it has a video-swiper component in miniprogram-component-plus of weChat team,  
which is not perfectly compatible with some scenarios,
such as some unexpected other video's voice playing when swiping the screen quickly,
customizing play/pause state, and community interactive features, etc.

Based on the video-swiper, other out-of-box component follows, such as `slider`, `comments-half-dialog`, `tiktok-panel`,
and `wechat-channel-panel` etc., with business bias features to build user friendly ui.

## Before Proceeding Further

@Miniprogram-video-swiper-kit/video-swiper is a easy-using component, but you should also consider weather it's
appropriate for your situation. Please don't use this kit just because someone said you should, instead, you should
take some time to understand the benefit and tradeoffs of using it.

Here are some suggestions on when it make sense to use it:

- Your business scenario is based on social community.
- You want a stable component that have been tested by massive client user.
- The @miniprogram-components-plus/video-swiper of weChat team doesn't meet your demand, you can take a try.

On the other hand, this component's features about ui properties or events are not fully exported for you,
some of them are hard code in pkg now, I will pick them out progressively.
